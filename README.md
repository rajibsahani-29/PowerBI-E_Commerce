# E-Commerce Dashboard
This ecommerce KPI dashboard gives online sellers a quick view of key metrics like revenue, orders, profit margin, and average order value. It pulls data from Shopify and other sources to provide a complete picture, including business expenses and profit &amp; loss.

📊 Overview
Ecommerce KPI dashboards offer online retailers a clear snapshot of store performance across critical business metrics. To succeed, ecommerce businesses must optimize every step of the customer journey—from first visit to final conversion. These dashboards help track progress and adapt quickly to changes.
