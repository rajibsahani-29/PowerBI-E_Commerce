# E-Commerce Dashboard
This ecommerce KPI dashboard gives online sellers a quick view of key metrics like revenue, orders, profit margin, and average order value. It pulls data from Shopify and other sources to provide a complete picture, including business expenses and profit &amp; loss.

ðŸ“Š Overview
Ecommerce KPI dashboards offer online retailers a clear snapshot of store performance across critical business metrics. To succeed, ecommerce businesses must optimize every step of the customer journeyâ€”from first visit to final conversion. These dashboards help track progress and adapt quickly to changes.

ðŸ›’ Platform Integration
Many of this dashboardâ€™s key metrics are directly pulled from Shopify, which serves as the sellerâ€™s primary ecommerce platform. It monitors essential figures such as:

ðŸ§¾ Total Revenue

ðŸ“¦ Number of Orders

ðŸ’° Average Order Value (AOV)

ðŸ“‰ Profit Margin

These KPIs provide a deeper understanding of business health, beyond just sales volume.

ðŸ’¼ Financial Insights
In addition to Shopify data, the dashboard includes a Profit & Loss statement summarizing key expenses from the previous monthâ€”such as marketing, shipping, or operational costs.
ðŸ“‚ These financial metrics are sourced separately and visualized alongside Shopify data to give a more holistic view of profitability.
